            </h4>
            <p class="fillp2">
                The memorandum of understanding (MOU) is an agreement between the United Nations and a Member State to establish the administrative, logistics and financial terms and conditions to govern the contribution of personnel, equipment, and services provided in support of a peace operation and to specify United Nations standards of conduct for personnel provided by the Government. <br>

                In 1996, the General Assembly authorized procedures for determining reimbursements to Member States for their contributions to peace operations. As a result, an MOU between the UN and the troop or police contributing country is established for every formed military or police unit deployed to a peace oepration. The MOU details the major equipment, self-sustainment services, and personnel which the contributing country is asked to deploy, and for which it is entitled to be financially reimbursed. There are over 300 MOUs covering deployed formed units and represent approximately $3 billion in equipment, services and troop costs annually. This is out of a total budget for UN peace operations of approximately $7 billion.

                Reimbursement Framework 

            </h4>
            <p class="fillp2">
                General Assembly resolutions 71/296, 67/261 and 68/281 effectively put in place a new framework for reimbursing troops and police contributed to the UN by Member States.  In addition, General Assembly resolution 68/282, endorsing the recommendations of the 2014 Contingent Owned Equipment (COE) working group, also introduced new measures related to reimbursement, including rotation of certain categories of equipment at the UN’s expense. <br>

                This framework highlights the importance of the reimbursement framework both for personnel and COE and its role in enhancing the effectiveness of United Nations peacekeeping and the peacekeeping partnership. The framework encompasses a number of interlinked measures which, for the first time, make an explicit link between contingent equipment and personnel including a measure whereby Member States with absent or non-functioning major equipment for two consecutive quarters are subject to a proportional deduction in their personnel payments.

            <p class="fillp2">
                Over more than four decades the United Nations has encountered difficulty in putting in place a clear and predictable system to help determine and adjust the rates of reimbursement to cover additional costs incurred by contributing countries deploying to United Nations peace operations.<br>

                A Senior Advisory Group (SAG) established by the Secretary-General, in 2011, to consider rates of reimbursement to troop-contributing countries and related issues, submitted its report to the Secretary-General (A/C.5/67/10), recommending a revised, more targeted and interactive approach that would link the process of collection of costs data, through a questionnaire, from a sample of “10 countries to be drawn from the top 20 T/PCCs, which should collectively account for a minimum of 50 per cent of total troops and police deployed over the three years prior to the survey. The sample 10 should include countries drawn from four income categories (high, high-medium, low-medium and low, based on World Bank data and classification), in proportion to the total number of troops and formed police units coming from countries in each of the income categories”. In its resolution 67/261, the General Assembly approved the new methodology to allow for a quadrennial consideration of the rates of reimbursement of contingent and formed police personnel.
                <br>
                This methodology was applied in 2014. The results of the 2014 survey were published in the Secretary-General report A/68/813.  The General Assembly, in resolution 68/281, subsequently approved a new reimbursement framework for contributing countries and a new single rate of reimbursement of $1,332 per person per month.  This new rate came into effect on 1 July 2014 and continued until 30 June 2016. The rate increased to $1,365 per person per month from 1 July 2016, and will increase to $1,410 from 1 July 2017.   A new survey will be undertaken in 2017/18, with results submitted for the consideration of the General Assembly during the second part of its resumed 72nd session.

                Contingent Owned Equipment

            </h4>
            <p class="fillp2">
                The Contingent Owned Equipment (COE) system was adopted by the United Nations to simplify the means by which countries are reimbursed for providing equipment, personnel and self-sustainment support services to formed military or police contingents in peace missions. The Memorandum of Understanding (MOU), the binding agreement between the UN and the Troop/Police Contributing Country (TCC/PCC) is the cornerstone of the COE system. The rates of reimbursement and the standards are reviewed every three years by a COE Working Group, an extension of the General Assembly. The last Working Group met in January 2017 and its recommendations were adopted by the General Assembly in its resolution 71/296. The resulting changes to the COE system are reflected in the 2017 COE Manual.

        <h3>
            Arriving at a mission
        </h3>
        <p>When a contingent arrives in the field for the first time, it may need to be responsible for its initial provisions e.g.   provide its own rations, water, fuel, and lubricants for the first 30 to 90 days. Following this initial period, the UN will normally provide rations, water, fuel and lubricants using commercial contracts, for the remainder of the contingent’s service in a mission.
        </p>
        <h3>Departing a mission
        </h3>
        <p>The same arrangements used in the deployment phase-- UN arrangements for moving troops and equipment to port, etc. -- are in effect for redeployment/repatriation. The COE staff conducts departure inspections, and the mission is responsible for base camp closure, rear party support, and provision of a departure security force if required.

        </p>
        <h3>
            Who carries out COE work?

        </h3>
        <p>Mission COE staff have a variety of backgrounds, many involving national or international logistics support operations. Many have served in the military, with specialties in transport, information technology, and administration. Others have experience as inspectors in the private sector. The number of COE inspectors per mission varies depending on the size of the mission, the number of MOU to verify, and other factors. Typically, a mission will have a COE Unit consisting of inspectors, a database manger, and administrative support staff. COE Unit staff will be joined by technical experts (civilian/military/police personnel) on days of inspections.
